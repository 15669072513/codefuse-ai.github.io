## Introduction
Codefuse-ModelCache is a semantic cache for large language models (LLMs). By caching pre-generated model results, it reduces response time for similar requests and improves user experience. <br />This project aims to optimize services by introducing a caching mechanism. It helps businesses and research institutions reduce the cost of inference deployment, improve model performance and efficiency, and provide scalable services for large models.  Through open-source, we aim to share and exchange technologies related to large model semantic cache.
